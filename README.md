# Leitner Box

What do you do when you want to remember something? You repeat it over and over.

The Leitner Box is a simple tool for spaced repetition learning.

I learned of the Leitner box through an amazing web comic thing created by Nicky Case called, [How to Remember Anything Forever-ish](https://ncase.me/remember/). It's a great time.

Also, here's a quick video on how to assemble it using paper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvF1XuseZFE

So basically, this project is me implementing my own Leitner box in code! Yay!
